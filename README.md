Bludo
=====

Bludo is a sample app using Meteor based in the idea of a blood donation system to help patients find blood donors near them.

## Users

- Donor: Can list as a donor using their current location and posting personal information and blood type which can be used by patients to contact them directly
- Patient: Can search for donors near their current location by seeing points in a map

## Non functional specs

- Single page app
- Geolocation features (HTML5)
- The postings should on the map should load real time, also new postings
- Lazy loading for geopoints on a map, only the ones that belong to the current area of map should be loaded and as the user navigates the map, more pins should appear
- Update views in real time without needing page refresh, as new postings get saved by patients should be able to see them
- Db should be NoSQL to scale out and handle all app components with JS

## Donor user stories

- As a donor I should be able to see a map centered around my current location when I first open the app
- As a donor I should be able to search for a location using an input form
- As a donor I should be able to find my location and tap/click on it and open a form in a popup
- As a donor I should be able to add contact info and blood group (first name, last name, contact number, email, address, blood group)
- As a donor I should be able to see a message if any input field has wrong format (wrong email address, telephone, etc)
- As a donor I should be able to see a success message with a unique private link after registration from where he can edit or delete my posting

## Patient user stories

- As a patient I should be able to see a map centered around my current location when I first open the app
- As a patient I should be able to see all the donor postings as small pins at their respective coordinates
- As a patient I should be able to see new pins (if existing) the moment I pan the map to another position
- As a patient I should be able to click on a posting pin and a popup should appear displaying the donorâ€™s information
- As a patient I should be able to see pins as they get added by new donors without refreshing the browser page
